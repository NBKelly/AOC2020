# ADVENT OF CODE 2020
This is a set of all my solutions for Advent of Code 2020. They are (mostly) cleaned up, and are all produced in Java using my own workflow tools (with a few hacks thrown in).

## Project Structure
All of the solutions are available in the ```com/nbkelly/advent``` folder. They can all be run using ```run.sh``` script like so:

1. Run a solution on the problem input with ```./run.sh 17```
2. Run a solution with a given input with ```./run.sh 17 [input_location]```
3. Run a solution using the debug/timer/except flags with ```./run.sh -d -t -se 17 [input_location]```

### Adding a solution
Open a soltuon to edit using the ```./workflow.sh``` command, like so:

1. ```./workflow.sh 17b``` If 17b exists, open it in emacs. Otherwise, prompt for the creation of that file.
